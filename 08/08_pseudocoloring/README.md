# Exercise 08: Pseudocoloring

## Instructions
1. Convert each image in 'Satellite Images' directory into an HSV image and detect all blue pixels in it. Use this as your reference: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html
2. Pseudocolor blue pixels in the image such that blue pixels near land areas are assigned red and parts of the ocean that are farthest from land are assigned violet. This pseudocoloring rule is based on the temperature of the ocean - those assigned red are hottest areas and those assigned violet are the coolest.

## List of requirements:
1. well-documented source code.
	a. format the file name of your main program as: <Surname1>_<Surname2>_Ex07.py
	b. in case of multiple files, submit a zip file with the same filename (except file extension, duh)
	c. do not include the angle brackets (duh)
	d. do not include build files
	e. do not include output images. put your output images in the report, if necessary.
2. a written report including the ff:
	a. a summary of what you have learned in this meeting
	b. the problem specifications (I/O)
	c. an explanation of ***how and why*** your solution works
	d. minimum of 500 words (***excluding bullet a***)
3. peer evaluation

Some note/s:
- **Requirement 2 and 3** are individual submissions

## Peer Evaluation
Create a private comment in our Google Classroom, in your exercise's submission thread, containing the ff:
1. The name of your groupmate (write surname first)
2. A rating for your groupmate's performance (choose in the range [0,100], 100 being the highest)
3. A justification for your chosen rating.
Create a separate comment for you and each of your groupmate/s.

For example, I would write the ff comments:
- POSERIO, CE; 100; designed the solution;
- MADRID, VLR; 100; implemented the solution perfectly.

## Deadlines
- **ALL requirements** are due the day before your next lab class, 11:59 pm.

## Scoring Guidelines
- **Requirement 1** is worth ***10 points***
- **Requirement 2** is worth ***5 points***
- Final Score = Average Peer Eval * Requirement 1 Score + Requirement 2 Score
